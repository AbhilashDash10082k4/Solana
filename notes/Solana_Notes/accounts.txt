Accounts -
EOA - externally owned accnts - do not have associated executable accnt, handled by pvt key, can send txns, send txns for contract executn, 
contract accnt - Contract account contain contract code. - aka Program accnts
They are created by external owned account or other contracts. 
Contracts, when created, are automatically assigned to an account address used for storing contract code and any storage data generated during contract deployment or execution. 
The address of a contract account is generated through the SHA3 hashing algorithm and not a private key.
As it lacks a private key, a contract account cannot be used as an external owned account. Contract execution and code invocation are only possible through an external owned account.
